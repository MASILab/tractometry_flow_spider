Connectoflow Spider from XNAT

Connectoflow [1] is Nextflow [2] pipeline to generate Connectomics [3,4] matrices from tractography data.
The key steps in this version of Connectoflow are:
- Decompose: This step performs the parcel-to-parcel decomposition of the tractogram. It includes streamline-cutting
    operations to ensure streamlines have terminations in the provided atlas. Moreover, connection-wise cleaning processes
    that remove loops, discard spurious streamlines and discard incoherent curvatures are used to remove as many false
    positives as possible [5].
- COMMIT: To further decrease the number of invalid streamlines and assign a quantitative weight to each streamline,
    Convex Optimization Modeling for Micro-structure Informed Tractography (COMMIT) [6,7] is used. This not only allows the
    removal of aberrant or spurious streamlines, but it was shown to increase reproducibility of connectivity measures by
    being more robust to various tractography biases. 
- AFD: Apparent Fiber Density (AFD) [8,9] is subsequently computed connection-wise using streamline orientations
    (fixel), which can be computationally burdensome if done on every pairwise connection of the connectome a posteriori.
    This step will provide a AFD-weighted connectivity matrix.
